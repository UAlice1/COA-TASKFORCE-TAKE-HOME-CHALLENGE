## Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Space Complexity: O(1).
## Usage
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Ange290/COA-TaskForce-Take-Home-Challenge.git
Navigate to the project directory:
Write cd COA-TaskForce-Take-Home-Challenge after also cd UI Challenge

# Array Manipulation
### Description
This coding challenge involves determining whether there exists a contiguous subarray within an array of integers that sums up to a target value. The goal is to return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.
## Constraints
The array will contain between 1 and 100,000 elements.
The elements in the array and the target sum will be between -1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
Expected Space Complexity: O(1).
## Usage
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/UAlice1/COA-TASKFORCE-TAKE-HOME-CHALLENGE.git
Navigate to the project directory:
 Write cd COA-TaskForce-Take-Home-Challenge after also cd Challenges and then <br>
Open terminal write node arrayMap.js .
# String Transformation
### Description
This coding challenge involves transforming a given string based on certain rules. The rules are as follows:
If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5, perform both operations in the order specified above.
### Problem Statement
Given a string, transform it based on the rules mentioned above.
### Constraints
The string will only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
The length of the string will be between 1 and 1000.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
Expected Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
## Usage
### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/Ange290/COA-TaskForce-Take-Home-Challenge.git
Navigate to the project directory:
 Write cd COA-TaskForce-Take-Home-Challenge after also cd Challenges and then <br>
Open terminal write node stringTransform.js .
